>   In the Binding request/response transaction, a Binding request is
>   sent from a STUN client to a STUN server.  When the Binding request
>   arrives at the STUN server, it may have passed through one or more
>   NATs between the STUN client and the STUN server (in Figure 1, there
>   were two such NATs).  As the Binding request message passes through a
>   NAT, the NAT will modify the source transport address (that is, the
>   source IP address and the source port) of the packet.  As a result,
>   the source transport address of the request received by the server
>   will be the public IP address and port created by the NAT closest to
>   the server.  This is called a reflexive transport address.  The STUN
>   server copies that source transport address into an XOR-MAPPED-
>   ADDRESS attribute in the STUN Binding response and sends the Binding
>   response back to the STUN client.  As this packet passes back through
>   a NAT, the NAT will modify the destination transport address in the
>   IP header, but the transport address in the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS
>   attribute within the body of the STUN response will remain untouched.
>   In this way, the client can learn its reflexive transport address
>   allocated by the outermost NAT with respect to the STUN server.
